# Alzheimer’s in great apes?

## Chimp brains show the presence of Alzheimer’s-linked proteins.

Can chimpanzees develop Alzheimer’s disease? A team of Kent State scientists may have found evidence that they can. The research team, led by Mary Ann Raghanti and Melissa Edler, has discovered markers of the disease in the brains of geriatric chimps. Their findings could pave the way for advances in understanding the progression and treatment of the disease in humans.

## Signs of Alzheimer’s in the aging brain

When we think of Alzheimer’s, we often think of its physical symptoms: forgetfulness, confusion, and the inability to form new memories, to name a few. The disease is typically confirmed at autopsy, when scientists can identify whether amyloid beta and tau — proteins associated with the disease — are present in the brain.

The Kent State research team recently discovered both proteins in the brains of geriatric chimpanzees, in the same regions as those affected by Alzheimer’s in humans.

In a paper just published in Neurobiology of Aging, the scientists say that finding these proteins in the brains of aged chimps suggests that Alzheimer's-like conditions aren’t limited to humans. Previously, scientists thought humans were uniquely suited to getting Alzheimer’s because of our genetic differences from other primates and our longer lifespans.

## Sample scarcity causes research challenges

In the past, our understanding of Alzheimer’s in non-human primates has been limited by scarce samples of brains from older chimps. In captivity, only 10 percent of male chimpanzees live to age 45 and only 10 percent of females to 55.

For this study, the research team examined brains from a group of 20 older chimpanzees. The chimps’ ages at death ranged from 37 to 62 years; specimens were provided by the National Chimpanzee Brain Resource.

## Promise for the future of Alzheimer’s research

While the discovery of amyloid-beta and tau lesions in chimp brains may mean that humans aren’t the only ones afflicted by the disease, more research is needed.

A true Alzheimer’s diagnosis requires behavioral and cognitive testing, which can shed light on the mental decline associated with the disease. To date, these tests haven’t been conducted with chimps.

Even so, these findings show promise for future Alzheimer’s research. "This research underscores the value of basic, comparative research in advancing our understanding of disease etiology and therapeutic targets," said Rebecca Ferrell, program director for NSF's Biological Anthropology program.

The research was partially supported by the National Science Foundation's (NSF) directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences.
