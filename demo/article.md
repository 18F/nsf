# Comb jellies hold keys to deep-sea evolution

## Comb jellies have evolved to live in vastly disparate environments.

Walk along a beach or pier in summer or fall and, if you're lucky, you may spot acomb jelly or two in the shallows. The luminescent drifters are named for the eight rows of shimmering combs that line their translucent bodies.

The teeth of these combs are tiny vibrating hairs that propel the creatures through the water. At night, comb jellies glow bright green or flash eerie blue light when disturbed by boaters or swimmers. Like fireflies on land, they produce their otherworldly glow by a chemical reaction involving a light-emitting enzyme.

## Vacuums of the sea are highly adaptable

Contrary to what their name implies, comb jellies (ctenophores) aren't true jellyfish. They don't have — or need — the stinging tentacles of actual jellyfish. Instead, they trap prey using adhesive cells. Swarms of these “vacuums of the sea” can devour whole patches of fish eggs in a matter of hours.

Marine scientists are well acquainted with how comb jellies hunt, but they’re still puzzling out how the creatures can survive in the deepest ocean realms. Marine scientists Steven Haddock of the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, Joseph Ryan of the University of Florida, and Erik Thuesen of Evergreen State College are hoping to unravel the mystery.

The researchers are studying ctenophore evolution and diversification using new molecular biology techniques. In particular, they’re investigating how the deep sea is causing adaptations in comb jellies — knowledge that may shed light on other animals’ evolution.

## Animal evolution and the “gelatinous lifestyle”

"A variety of ocean animals have evolved what might be called a 'gelatinous lifestyle,'" says Mike Sieracki, Dimensions of Biodiversity program director in NSF's Division of Ocean Sciences, which is helping to fund the ctenophore research. "Comb jellies live throughout the seas. It's important to know how diverse they are and how they have adapted to the extreme pressures of the deep ocean."

Adds Haddock, "The deep sea represents more than 90 percent of the inhabitable space on Earth, yet life there is largely a mystery to science."

Fragile and difficult to study, ctenophores are very important, says Haddock, in part because they may have been the first animals to split off from all other organisms during evolution, even before sponges and true jellyfish.

Over eons, many shallow-water marine organisms have shifted their home ranges to and from the deep sea, despite the differences between these habitats. Such habitat shifts required dramatic genetic and physiological changes.

Relationships among comb jelly species indicate that at least five of these transitions have taken place, with some ctenophores staying in shallow waters and others evolving to thrive in the deep sea, according to Haddock.

## From the shallows to the depths

Using scuba expeditions and remotely operated submersibles, the researchers are collecting samples from shallow water and deep-sea habitats to measure ctenophores' physiological capabilities and to sequence their genomes.

"The project is looking at closely related deep and shallow ctenophore species at biochemical, physiological, and genetic levels," says Haddock. "We're beginning to answer questions about the mechanisms of these animals' evolution, and are developing tools for analyzing ctenophore genome datasets."

Adds Ryan, "We've identified a set of genes present in all ctenophores, except for a group that lacks tentacles. Tentacle genes are especially important since that's where ctenophores store most of their stem cells."

The scientists are developing new ways of examining the genetics that influence comb jellies’ tolerances and ability to adapt to new environments. For example, says Thuesen, "the deep sea is capable of squishing the structure of some proteins, so we're investigating how ctenophore proteins function in high pressures." Finding the answers to this and other questions may shed light on longstanding mysteries of the deep.
