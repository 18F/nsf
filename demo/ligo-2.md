# Observatories locate black-hole collisions

## Three detectors — two in the U.S. and one in italy — make a major advance in locating cosmic collisions.

It’s the beginning of a new age — of gravitational-wave science, that is.

A black-hole collision noted by three gravitational-wave observatories (known as detectors) may be the most accurately located in history.

This is huge news in the realm of cosmic happenings; the more detectors that pick up on a collision, the more precisely scientists can localize it. With technology advancing as it is, we’ll soon have much deeper knowledge of where black holes are combining.

The collision between two black holes took place on August 14th (at 10:30:43 a.m. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), to put a fine point on it). Of the three detectors involved, two are Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors funded by NSF. The third — the Virgo detector — is situated in Pisa, Italy and funded by other organizations. This was Virgo’s first detection.

## Making (and detecting) waves

The detection of gravitational waves is a relatively new development in cosmic science. It was just over a year and a half ago that the LIGO observatory made the first-ever detection of gravitational waves. The source of said waves? Two black holes colliding in a galaxy a (literal) billion light years away.

NSF Director Dr. France Córdova shared her enthusiasm for the most recent detection, stating, “We’re delighted to announce the first discovery made in partnership between the Virgo gravitational-wave observatory and the LIGO Scientific Collaboration...This is an exciting milestone in the growing international scientific effort to unlock the extraordinary mysteries of our universe."

The detected waves — ripples in space and time — began during the final moments of the merger of two black holes. One black hole had a mass of about 31 times that of our sun, and the other had roughly 25 times the mass of the sun. The event took place a cool 1.8 billion light years away.

## We've only just begun

"This is just the beginning of observations with the network enabled by Virgo and LIGO working together," says David Shoemaker of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). "With the next observing run planned for fall 2018, we can expect such detections weekly or even more often."

Beyond expecting more frequent detections, we can also start to expect more accurate ones. As current detectors become “second-generation” (i.e., more accurate) detectors, we’ll have a much better handle on where collisions are happening.

"With this first joint detection by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors, we have taken one step further into the gravitational-wave cosmos," says Caltech's David H. Reitze, executive director of the LIGO lab. "Virgo brings a powerful new capability to detect and better locate gravitational-wave sources, one that will undoubtedly lead to exciting and unanticipated results in the future."

LIGO is funded by the National Science Foundation and operated by Caltech and MIT, which conceived and built the project. Financial support for the Advanced LIGO project was led by NSF with Germany (Max Planck Society), the U.K. (Science and Technology Facilities Council) and Australia (Australian Research Council) making significant commitments and contributions to the project. More than 1,200 scientists from around the world participate in the effort through the LIGO Scientific Collaboration, which includes the GEO Collaboration. Additional partners are listed at LIGO Partners and Collaborations.

The Virgo collaboration consists of more than 280 physicists and engineers belonging to 20 different European research groups: six from Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS) in France; eight from the Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (INFN) in Italy; two in The Netherlands including Nikhef; the MTA Wigner Research Centre for Physics in Hungary; the Polgraw group in Poland; the University of Valencia in Spain; and the European Gravitational Observatory, the laboratory hosting the Virgo detector near Pisa in Italy.
