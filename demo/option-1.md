# Comb jellies shed light on animal adaptability

## Faux jellyfish have a lot to share about other species’ evolution.

If you’ve walked along a beach in the summer or fall, you’ve probably seen a comb jelly. Named for the iridescent combs lining their bodies, comb jellies aren’t true jellyfish. They’re ctenophores — simple marine animals that use their “combs” to move them through the water.

The jellies’ luminescence and locomotion habits aren’t what scientists find most fascinating about them, though. These shapeless critters may hold keys to understanding how animals evolve to thrive in the deep sea. Current NSF-funded research may help scientists gain a deeper knowledge of how animals adapt to life in extreme environments.

## Highly adaptable vacuums of the sea

Unlike true jellyfish, comb jellies don’t have — or need — stinging tentacles. Instead, they trap prey using adhesive cells. Swarms of these sea vacuums can devour whole patches of fish eggs in mere hours.

Though scientists are pretty well acquainted with how comb jellies hunt, but they’re still puzzling out how the creatures can survive in the deep ocean. Marine scientists Steven Haddock (Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute), Joseph Ryan (University of Florida), and Erik Thuesen (Evergreen State College) are hoping to unravel the mystery.

The researchers are using new molecular biology techniques to study comb jelly evolution and diversification. In particular, they’re looking into how the deep sea is causing adaptations in comb jellies — knowledge that may shed light on how other animals have evolved.

## Animal evolution and the “gelatinous lifestyle”

"A variety of ocean animals have evolved what might be called a 'gelatinous lifestyle,'" says Mike Sieracki of NSF's Division of Ocean Sciences, which is helping to fund this research. "Comb jellies live throughout the seas. It's important to know how diverse they are and how they have adapted to the extreme pressures of the deep ocean."

Fragile and difficult to study, comb jellies are very important, says Haddock, in part because they may have been the first animals to split off from all other organisms during evolution, even before sponges and true jellyfish.

Over eons, many shallow-water ocean animals took up residence in the deep sea, despite the challenges that habitat presents. This habitat shifting required major genetic and physiological changes of the animals that attempted it.

Relationships among comb jelly species indicate that at least five of these shallow-to-deep transitions have taken place, with some jellies staying in shallow waters and others evolving to thrive in the deep sea, according to Haddock. Because jellies have diversified to thrive in vastly different settings, their history can shed light on the larger story of animal evolution.

## From the shallows to the depths

Researchers are currently collecting samples from shallow-water and deep-sea habitats to measure comb jellies’ physiological capabilities and to sequence their genomes.

"The project is looking at closely related deep and shallow ctenophore species at biochemical, physiological, and genetic levels," says Haddock. "We're beginning to answer questions about the mechanisms of these animals' evolution, and are developing tools for analyzing ctenophore genome datasets."

Scientists are developing new ways of examining the genetics that influence comb jellies’ tolerances and ability to adapt to new environments. For example, says Thuesen, "the deep sea is capable of squishing the structure of some proteins, so we're investigating how ctenophore proteins function in high pressures." Finding the answers to this and other questions may shed light on longstanding mysteries of the deep.
